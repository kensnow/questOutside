# Introduction

QuestOutside is a gamified hiking web App.  

QuestOutside allows a user to create an account, as well as recieve and complete level based hiking 'quests' 

## Why QuestOutside?

The concept of QuestOutside is to gamifying and creating a reward system using difficult and worthy objectives in the hiking community.  

## Technology Stack

QuestOutside is a full-stack web application featuring the MERN Stack.  A full list of the tech and dependencies are as follows:

+ ReactJS
+ NodeJS
+ Express
+ MongoDB
+ Axios
+ React Router
+ Bcrypt
+ Express-JWT
+ JSON web token

The project features unique users, Token Based Authentication, and encrypted password storage.  For a backend built on NodeJS, 3 seperate Schemas built with Mongoose, and used Express to run the server.  

The front end was build using React, async API calls with Axios.  The App uses Context for passing props and handler functions, and is a Single Page Application using React Router.

## Learning Project
QuestOutside is a learning  project to get a handle of developing a full-stack CRUD Web Application. 

I like the concept of both gamification and augmented-reality, and felt an app to integrate a reward scheme would be exciting to work on.

The project is still being worked on, and is currently being refactored.  You can follow its progress here: https://github.com/kensnow/quest-outside
