QuestOutside is a gamified hiking web App.  

QuestOutside allows a user to create an account, as well as recieve and complete level based hiking 'quests'

The concept of QuestOutside is to gamifying and creating a reward system using difficult and worthy objectives in the hiking community.

## Learning Project
QuestOutside is a learning  project to get a handle of developing a full-stack CRUD Web Application. 

I like the concept of both gamification and augmented-reality, and felt an app to integrate a reward scheme would be exciting to work on.

The project is still being worked on, and is currently being refactored.  You can follow its progress here: https://github.com/kensnow/quest-outside
